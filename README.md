## CALCULATOR WEB APP
developed the calculator web app using next js framework in which I have designed the whole app including the landing page with some animations


## Why Next Js
as next js is build on top of react js which provides us the additional features which are beneficial for my projects
features such as separate renderings (server side and client side) which makes our website efficient in search engine optimization (react does not offer ssr capabilities) , 
Automatic code splitting which in turn gives faster load time and better performance , 
Routing,
SSR
Api Routes
